# Slack Workflows
A collection of useful Slack workflows for HR teams, courtesy of Hear Me Out.

## Installation
1. Decide which channel the workflow will belong to (workflows are tied to channels). If your team has a #help channel, that’s probably a good candidate.
2. Download the workflows to your local computer [here](https://github.com/hearmeout-co/slack-workflows/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
3. [Navigate to Workflow Builder](http://slack.com/launch-workflows) and select “Import”.
4. Once imported, edit the workflow and customize the channel and notification recipients for your team.
5. Publish and let everyone know about the new workflow.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the channel you selected during installation.
2. Click the `+` icon next to the message box.
3. Select the workflow to kick it off.
